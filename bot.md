# Solana Trading Bot System Design

## 1. Wallet Tracker
- Implement a service to continuously monitor the specified wallets (and any you add later).
- Use Solana's JSON RPC API to fetch real-time transaction data.

## 2. Transaction Analyzer
- Parse incoming transactions to identify token purchases and sales.
- Calculate key metrics like entry/exit points, holding time, and profit/loss.

## 3. Strategy Emulator
- For each wallet, create a model of its trading strategy based on historical data.
- Factors to consider: market cap at entry, holding periods, exit conditions.

## 4. Decision Engine
- Combine data from multiple wallets to make trading decisions.
- Implement configurable risk management rules.

## 5. Execution Module
- Interface with Solana to execute trades based on the Decision Engine's output.
- Implement safety checks and circuit breakers to prevent unexpected losses.

## 6. Telegram Bot
- Create a bot to send real-time alerts and summaries to Telegram.
- Include commands for users to check status, adjust settings, or manually override trades.

## 7. Performance Tracker
- Log all actions and outcomes for analysis.
- Generate periodic reports on bot performance, comparing to tracked wallets.

## 8. Linux Service
- Package the entire system as a systemd service for continuous operation.
- Implement proper logging and error handling for unattended running.

## 9. Configuration System
- Allow easy addition of new wallets to track.
- Provide options to adjust risk tolerance, investment amounts, and other parameters.

## Tech Stack:
- Rust for core logic and Solana interaction
- TypeScript for the Telegram bot frontend
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for local data storage
- Docker for easy deployment and scaling
